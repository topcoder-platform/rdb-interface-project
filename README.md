# Relational Database Interface Project

This project contains the raw protobuf files needed to generate a gRPC service for accessing relational databases from Java. A Java application can use this service to access a relational database without having to write any SQL.
See [here](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/informix-access-layer) for an example usage.
